## 3D in AI Workflow Canvases

### Raelume WORLDS
Raelume's WORLDS blocks offer a different approach to 3D:
- Convert 2D images to 3D environments via Gaussian splatting
- Place 3D objects in scenes
- Free camera movement
- Capture 2K-4K images from any angle
- VR viewing coming soon

### Krea Stage
Krea's Stage feature (launched April 2025):
- Convert images to editable 3D scenes
- Environment creation from text/images
- Integrated with their node workflow

## Emerging Technologies

### Gaussian Splatting
A reconstruction technique that creates 3D scenes from 2D images:
- Real-time rendering on consumer hardware
- Photorealistic results
- Faster than traditional NeRF
- Being integrated into creative workflows (e.g., Raelume WORLDS)

### World Models
A new category combining 3D generation with interactivity:
- See [World Models](world-models.md) for Genie 3, Marble, etc.
