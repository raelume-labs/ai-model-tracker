## Production-Grade Gaussian Splatting Workflows

The Gaussian splatting ecosystem continues maturing rapidly with production tools finally catching up to the research potential. Key developments include:

**Standards Adoption:** The Khronos Group's glTF working group has standardized Gaussian splat formats, providing developers with consistent import/export workflows across tools.

**Tool Ecosystem:** Production-ready tools now span from Luma AI's refined NeRF capture pipeline to Polycam's batch processing for architectural workflows. ComfyUI's 3D-Pack extension continues serving technical users with node-based workflows.

**Real Production Use:** Companies like Zillow (real estate), Framestore (VFX for Superman production), and architectural firms are shipping commercial projects built on Gaussian splat technology.

**Limitations Remain:** Edge artifacts, baked lighting constraints, and limited editing capabilities still affect production adoption for certain use cases.

## Continued Seedance 2.0 Buzz

ByteDance's Seedance 2.0 continues generating industry discussion three days after CNN's coverage of Hollywood concerns. The model's multimodal input capabilities and director-level control are being favorably compared to Sora 2 and Kling 3.0 for cinematic quality.

Independent reviews from Curious Refuge note that while Seedance 2.0 outperforms Kling 3 in certain scenarios, delivery can appear robotic in some contexts.
