## Google Lyria 3 Transforms Multimodal Music Generation

Google DeepMind's **Lyria 3** (released February 18-19, 2026) represents a breakthrough in multimodal music generation, allowing users to create 30-second tracks with auto-generated lyrics and vocals from images, videos, and text descriptions.

The model is now integrated into the **Gemini app** with availability rolling out to users aged 18+. Unlike traditional text-to-music generators, Lyria 3's multimodal approach enables creative workflows where visual content directly informs musical composition.

Key capabilities include:
- Visual-to-audio translation for photos and videos
- Automatic lyric and vocal generation
- Integration with Gemini's conversational interface
- 30-second track generation optimized for social media

This release positions Google directly against existing music generation leaders like Suno v4 and Udio, while leveraging Google's multimodal AI expertise to differentiate through visual input capabilities.
